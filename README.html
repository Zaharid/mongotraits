<h1 id="mongotraits">Mongotraits</h1>
<p>A liteweight simple Object Document Manager to connect python objects to MongoDB.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fields are IPython TraitTypes with the metadata db=True.</li>
<li>Objects with the same id are always the same python object.</li>
<li>References are special TraitType subclasses that implement a dereference and a ref methods.</li>
<li>References to embedded objects are possible.</li>
<li>Arbitrary objects can be saved: They either implement a savedict and to_classdict methods, are represented unchanged if they are of the right type (SAME_TYPES) or they are pickled.</li>
<li>Container traits are handled correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The drawbacks I can think of are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance has not been taken into account at all.</li>
<li>No fancy query meta language (but pymongo is easy enough to use).</li>
</ul>
